# scrapli-netbox-juniper-scripts
Some Scripts I use to collect info from juniper routers integrating with Netbox

I use Scrapli Async to sendo visual commands to routers.
To use this you need to edit .env file with your netbox info.

Obs: My netbox, all backbone routers use tag == [CORE], so in your case you must change this tag
